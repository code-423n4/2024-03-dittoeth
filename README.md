- Issues related to the start/bootstrap of the protocol
  - When there are few ShortRecords or TAPP is low, it's easy to fall into a black swan scenario
  - Ditto rewards: first claimer gets 100% of ditto reward, also `dittoShorterRate` can give more/less ditto than expected (see [L-21](https://www.codehawks.com/report/clm871gl00001mp081mzjdlwc#L-21)).
  - Empty order book can lead to issues: matching self can get ditto rewards/yield. Creating a low bid (see [L-16](https://www.codehawks.com/report/clm871gl00001mp081mzjdlwc#L-16)) isn't likely since anyone would want to simply match against it. Creating a high short that eventually matches seems impossible with real orders. Can also prevent creating an order too far away from the oracle.
- Not finished with governance/token setup
- Issues related to oracles
  - Oracle is very dependent on Chainlink, stale/invalid prices fallback to a Uniswap TWAP. 2 hours staleness means it can be somewhat out of date.
- Issues related to front-running: can front-run someone's order, liquidation, the chainlink/uniswap oracle update.
- Bridge credit system (for LST arb, since rETH/stETH is mixed)
  - If user has LST credit but that bridge is empty, LST credit can be redeemed for the other base collateral at 1-1 ratio
  - In NFT transfer, LST credit is transferred up to the amount of the collateral in the ShortRecord, which includes collateral that comes from bidder, might introduce a fee on minting a NFT
  - Thus, credits don't prevent arbitrage from either yield profits or trading: credit is only tracked on deposits/withdraw and not at the more granular level of matching trades or how much credit is given for yield from LSTs.
- There is an edge case where a Short meets `minShortErc` requirements because of `ercDebtRate` application
- `disburseCollateral` in `proposeRedemption()` can cause user to lose yield if their SR was recently modified and itâ€™s still below 2.0 CR (modified through order fill, or increase collateral)
- Recovery Mode: currently not checking `recoveryCR` in secondary liquidation unlike primary, may introduce later.
- Incentives should mitigate actions from bad/lazy actors and promote correct behavior, but they do not guarantee perfect behavior:
  - That Primary Liquidations happen
  - Redemptions in the exact sorted order
- Redemptions
  - Proposals are intentionally overly conservative in considering an SR to ineligible (with regards to `minShortErc`) to prevent scenarios of ercDebt under `minShortErc`
  - There is an issue when `claimRemainingCollateral()` is called on a SR that is included in a proposal and is later correctly disputed.
  - Undecided on how to distribute the redemption fee, maybe to dusd holders rather than just the system.
  - Currently allowed to redeem at any CR under 2, even under 1 CR.

# Overview

## About Ditto

The Ditto protocol is a new decentralized stable asset protocol for Ethereum mainnet. It takes in overcollateralized liquid staked ETH (rETH, stETH) to create stablecoins using a gas optimized orderbook (starting with a USD stablecoin, dUSD).

On the orderbook, bidders and shorters bring ETH, askers can sell their dUSD. Bidders get the dUSD, shorters get the bidders collateral and a ShortRecord to manage their debt position (similar to a CDP). Shorters get the collateral of the position (and thus the LST yield), with the bidder getting the stable asset, rather than a CDP where the user also gets the asset.

## High Level Changes

This is large update to the original [codebase](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-09-ditto), so the scope doesn't encompass everything that will be relevant to review it. Most of the changes are to address previously known issues or findings from the last audit (if you want to review previous findings, you can filter by "finding-x" in the [Codehawk submissions](https://www.codehawks.com/submissions/clm871gl00001mp081mzjdlwc)).

- Enable better enforcement of minimum Orders (see Codehawks "finding-145": [M-02. User can create small position after exit with bid](https://www.codehawks.com/report/clm871gl00001mp081mzjdlwc#M-02)), and in particular a minimum ShortRecord debt requirement (makes liquidation worth it).
  - Previously this only included `minBidEth`, `minAskEth`, `minShortErc` which was checked during the start of `createBid`,`createAsk`, `createLimitShort` calls.
  - Tries to enforce a min Order after partial matches by cancelling the dust amount of an order, rather than only if the result is less than 1 wei.
  - Now it checks _after_ execution, in any function that relates to ShortRecords (primary liquidation, secondary liquidation, exit short, etc). If a ShortRecord has less than the minShortErc, some operations may _cancel_ the corresponding Short Order (adding the collateral/debt into the SR like a CDP) to enable the ShortRecord to contain at least minShortErc.
- Fix issues related to withdrawals (see "finding-579" [L-13. Instant arbitrage opportunity through rETH and stETH price discrepancy](https://www.codehawks.com/report/clm871gl00001mp081mzjdlwc#L-13)): introduce a "credit" system for when LST (rETH/stETH) is deposited to handle arbitrage between depositing and withdrawing. Users can only withdraw what type of LST they deposit with. Any extra withdrawals due to yield gain will be given based on checking the oracle price difference between the LSTs. Also remove
- Add redemptions feature similar in purpose to Liquity (not a fork): allows redeeming stable asset (dusd) for eth, from lowest collateral ratio ShortRecord to highest. However, ShortRecords are not sorted on-chain, so users must propose a set of ShortRecords will a calculated dispute time (if disputed there is a penalty). Then after the time passes, users can claim their corresponding redemption. There is also a maximum limit CR that is allowed (at the moment, 2 CR) to be redeemable, meaning if the lowest CR short is 2 CR, the redemption function cannot be used.
- Help with a potential DUSD discount: when matches happen (bid/ask) below oracle price, the fee/tithe increases accordingly, meaning shorters decrease in yield and some may be incentivized to exit, which happens until some equilibrium is reached.
- A simple "Recovery Mode" like functionality, when the overall total CR of the system is under 150%, liquidation can happen at 150% instead of 110%.
- Remove flagging concept from primary liquidations.
- Redemptions have been introduced with the intention to be available before primary/secondary liquidation methods. Upon deploy/release, the associated threshold for liquidations should be lower than the redemption CR.
- Allow Short Orders to be leveraged, assuming they provide enough to cover minShortErc when matched against a bid.

# Additional Context

- [x] Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts
- [x] Please list specific ERC20 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with. Could be "any" (literally anything, fee on transfer tokens, ERC777 tokens and so forth) or a list of tokens you envision using on launch.
  - Lido (stETH) and Rocketpool (rETH) and potentially other LSTs in the future
- [x] Please list specific ERC721 that your protocol is anticipated to interact with.
  - Ditto's own ShortRecord(s) _can_ become an NFT if it's minted/transferred
- [x] Which blockchains will this code be deployed to, and are considered in scope for this audit?
  - Ethereum mainnet only
- [x] Please list all trusted roles (e.g. operators, slashers, pausers, etc.), the privileges they hold, and any conditions under which privilege escalation is expected/allowable
  - Owner: Highest level of access, ability to create new vaults and markets, in addition to parameter changes
  - Admin: Secondary role to allow quicker response time to sensitive actions, includes parameter changes
- [ ] In the event of a DOS, could you outline a minimum duration after which you would consider a finding to be valid? This question is asked in the context of most systems' capacity to handle DoS attacks gracefully for a certain period.
- [ ] Is any part of your implementation intended to conform to any EIP's? If yes, please list the contracts in this format:
  - `Contract1`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPX`
  - `Contract2`: Should comply with `ERC/EIPY`

## Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)

- Redemptions, as this is an entirely new concept to the protocol.
- Anything related to Orderbook matching logic, can get complicated in terms of what was done to save gas
  - The Orderbook only allows matching a Short Order at or above oracle price, unlike bids/asks so that part acts differently than an usual orderbook
  - Oracle price is cached to 15m, mostly done to allow the hint system to work (placing bids in sorted position in a mapping as a linked list is expensive, so the hint is used to know where in the list an order should go). This is worse with a short order because short orders can't be matched below oracle price. But if the oracle price is always changing, it is difficult to pick a hint that will be valid when the transaction happens, so the system allows for 0.5% buffer and allows matching backwards in this scenario until it reaches the correct "starting short id", which is the short order id that represents the first short order that can be correctly matched (at or above oracle).
- Dust amounts: want to prevent small orders on the orderbook to prevent skyrocketing gas costs for large orders that match with multiple limit orders
- Concept of `minShortErc`: Primary liquidators should always have a large enough incentive to liquidate (`callerFeePct` tied to liquidated collateral) risky debt because every ShortRecord must either contain enough ercDebt or have access to enough ercDebt (through cancelling the associated short order). The one noted exception is listed in known issues (ercDebt requirements met from application of ercDebtRate)
- Anything related to being able to correctly liquidate/exit ShortRecords that are a certain collateral ratio

## Main invariants

> Describe the project's main invariants (properties that should NEVER EVER be broken).

See [docs](https://dittoeth.com/technical/concepts) for more info.

### Orderbook

Ditto's orderbook acts similar to central limit orderbook with some changes. In order to make the gas costs low, there is a hint system added to enable a user to place an order in the orderbook mapping. Asks/Shorts are both on the "sell" side of the orderbook. Order structs are reused by implementing the orders as a doubly linked-list in a mapping. `HEAD` order is used as a starting point to match against.

- Ask orders get matched before short orders at the same price.
- Bids sorted high to low
- Asks/Shorts sorted low to high
- Only cancelled/matched orders can be reused (Technically: Left of HEAD (`HEAD.prevId`) these are the only possible OrderTypes: `O.Matched`, `O.Cancelled`, `O.Uninitialized`).
- Since bids/asks/shorts share the same `orderId` counter, every single `orderId` should be unique

### Short Orders

`shortOrders` can only be limit orders. `startingShort` represents the first short order that can be matched. Normally `HEAD.nextId` would the next short order in the mapping, but it's not guaranteed that it is matchable since users can still create limit shorts under the oracle price (or they move below oracle once the price updates). Oracle updates from chainlink or elsewhere will cause the `startingShort` to move, which means the system doesn't know when to start matching from without looping through each short, so the system allows a temporary matching backwards.

- `shortOrder` can't match under `oraclePrice`
- `startingShort` price must be greater than or equal to `oraclePrice`
- `shortOrder` with a non-zero (ie. positive) `shortRecordId` means that the referenced SR is status partialFill

### ShortRecords

ShortRecords are the Vaults/CDPs/Troves of Ditto. SRs represent a collateral/debt position by a shorter. Each user can have multiple SRs, which are stored under their address as a list.

- The only time `shortRecord` debt can be below `minShortErc` is when it's partially filled and the connected `shortOrder` has enough `ercDebt` to make up the difference to `minShortErc` (Technically: `SR.status` == `PartialFill` && `shortOrder.ercAmount` + `ercDebt` >= `minShortErc`)
- Similarly, SR can never be `SR.FullyFilled` and be under `minShortErc`
- `FullyFilled` SR can never have 0 collateral
- Only SR with status `Closed` can ever be re-used (Technically, only `SR.Closed` on the left (prevId) side of HEAD, with the exception of HEAD itself)

### Redemptions

Allows dUSD holders to get equivalent amount of ETH back, akin to Liquity. However the system doesn't automatically sort the SR's lowest to highest. Instead, users propose a list of SRs (an immutable slate) to redeem against. There is a dispute period to revert any proposal changes and a corresponding penalty against a proposer if incorrect. Proposers can claim the ETH after the time period, and shorters can also claim any remaining collateral afterwards.

- Only the first and last proposal can possibly be partially redeemed
- Proposal "slates" are sorted least to highest CR
- All CR in `proposedData` dataTypes should be under 2 CR
- Check before proposal, the `ercDebt` of SR cannot be zero. After proposal, check it cannot be `SR.Closed`` until claimed
- If proposal happens, check to see that there is no issues with SSTORE2 (the way it is saved and read)
- Relationship between proposal and SR's current `collateral` and `ercDebt` amounts. The sum total should always add up to the original amounts (save those amounts)

### BridgeRouter/Bridge

Because the Vault mixes rETH/stETH, a credit system is introduced to allow users to withdraw only what they deposit, anything in excess (due to yield) also checks either LSTs price difference using a TWAP via Uniswap.

- deposit/withdraw gives/removes an appropriate amount of virtual dETH (ETH equivalent), no matter if someone deposits an LST (rETH, stETH), or ETH and accounts for yield that is gained over time.

- To run local node: `bun run anvil-fork`, then deploy with `bun run deploy-local`
- `bun run interfaces` to re-compile solidity interfaces to `interfaces/`
- `bun run build` to compile contracts, foundry cache in `foundry/`

tests are located in `/test/` and `test-gas/`: contains unit, fork, gas, invariant tests

- `bun run test`
  - `-- --vv` for verbosity
  - `-- --watch` to watch files
  - `-- -m testX` to match tests
- `bun run test-fork`: gas fork tests read from `MAINNET_RPC_URL`
- `bun run test-gas` for gas tests, reads `test-gas/`, writes gas to `.gas.json`
- `bun run coverage` (first `brew install lcov`)

## Miscellaneous

If you get an error like:

> Error (9582): Member "asdf" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in contract IDiamond.

It means you need to rebuild the `interfaces/` and run `bun run interfaces-force`, which generates `interfaces/Interface.sol` which are imported in the `contracts/`

If there's an error with fork tests due to RPC, may need to disable those tests or switch RPC to local node or a different one via changing the `.env` like so: `MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth.drpc.org`. I would suggest any at [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/1).
